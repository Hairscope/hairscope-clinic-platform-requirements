## What “Daily Schedule” means

**Daily Schedule** means: use the treatment every calendar day, with one or more planned uses during that day.

It answers:

> “How many times should the treatment be used each day, and what should happen at each daily use?”

It does **not** mean the patient must use the treatment at an exact clock time. Morning, Midday, Afternoon, Evening, Night, and Any time describe general parts of the day.

### Example: once daily in the morning

UI fields:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Routine type | `Daily schedule` |
| Number of daily uses | `1` |
| Time of day | `Morning` |
| Meal timing | `No Preference` |
| Dosage | `1 tablet` |
| How to apply / use? | `Oral` |
| Duration | `3` |
| Duration unit | `Month(s)` |

Meaning:

> Use 1 tablet orally every morning for 3 months.

The resulting routine is:

```json
{
  "type": "DAILY",
  "timesPerDay": 1,
  "slots": [
    {
      "timeOfDay": "MORNING",
      "mealRelation": "NONE",
      "dosage": "1 tablet"
    }
  ],
  "routeOrArea": "Oral",
  "duration": {
    "value": 3,
    "unit": "MONTH"
  }
}
```
## How to fill the Daily Schedule UI

### 1. Select the routine type

Choose:

```text
Daily schedule
```

Use this when the treatment is used every day.

### 2. Enter Number of daily uses

This is required and must be a whole number from 1 to 24.

The number entered controls the number of Daily uses shown below it:

```text
Number of daily uses: 2

Daily use 1
Daily use 2
```

The number of Daily uses must exactly match the number entered. The form creates or removes the entries automatically when the number changes.

A Daily schedule always starts with:

```text
Number of daily uses: 1
```

### 3. Complete each Daily use

Each Daily use has three fields:

#### Time of day

Choose the general period when the treatment should be used:

- Morning
- Midday
- Afternoon
- Evening
- Night
- Any time

These values describe a general part of the day, not an exact clock time.

#### Meal timing

Choose the relationship between the treatment and a meal:

- No Preference
- Before Meal
- With Meal
- After Meal

`No Preference` means that no particular meal timing is specified.

#### Dosage

Enter the dosage or application instruction for that specific Daily use.

Examples:

```text
1 tablet
2 tablets
Apply a thin layer
1 pump
Use once
```

### 4. Complete How to apply / use?

Use this field to describe the route, application method, or treatment area.

Examples:

```text
Oral
Scalp
Apply to affected area
Face and neck
Use as a topical application
```

### 5. Complete Duration

Duration is optional. If used, enter the amount and select its unit.

Example:

```text
Duration: 3
Duration unit: Month(s)
```

## Common use cases

### 1. One use every morning

```text
Routine type: Daily schedule
Number of daily uses: 1

Daily use 1:
Time of day: Morning
Meal timing: No Preference
Dosage: 1 capsule

How to apply / use?: Oral
Duration: 3 Month(s)
```

Meaning:

> Use 1 capsule every morning for 3 months.

### 2. Different dosage in the morning and evening

```text
Routine type: Daily schedule
Number of daily uses: 2

Daily use 1:
Time of day: Morning
Meal timing: Before Meal
Dosage: 2 tablets

Daily use 2:
Time of day: Night
Meal timing: No Preference
Dosage: 1 tablet
```

Meaning:

> Use 2 tablets before a meal in the morning and 1 tablet at night every day.

This is one of the main reasons to use `DAILY`: each Daily use can have a different dosage.

### 3. Same topical treatment twice daily

```text
Routine type: Daily schedule
Number of daily uses: 2

Daily use 1:
Time of day: Morning
Meal timing: No Preference
Dosage: Apply a thin layer

Daily use 2:
Time of day: Evening
Meal timing: No Preference
Dosage: Apply a thin layer

How to apply / use?: Scalp
Duration: 2 Month(s)
```

Meaning:

> Apply a thin layer to the scalp every morning and evening for 2 months.

### 4. Daily use associated with meals

```text
Routine type: Daily schedule
Number of daily uses: 1

Daily use 1:
Time of day: Any time
Meal timing: With Meal
Dosage: 1 capsule
```

Meaning:

> Use 1 capsule once every day with a meal.

This does not specify breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

### 5. Daily use at night

```text
Routine type: Daily schedule
Number of daily uses: 1

Daily use 1:
Time of day: Night
Meal timing: No Preference
Dosage: Apply as directed

How to apply / use?: Scalp
Duration: 1 Month(s)
```

Meaning:

> Apply the treatment once every day at night.

## When not to use Daily Schedule

### Use `INTERVAL` instead

Use `INTERVAL` when the important rule is the elapsed time between uses.

Example:

```text
Every 8 hours
```

Use:

- `DAILY` for Morning, Evening, Night, or other daily uses
- `INTERVAL` for a fixed number of hours or days between uses

### Use `SPECIFIC_DAYS` instead

Use `SPECIFIC_DAYS` when the treatment occurs only on selected weekdays.

Example:

```text
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
```

That is not a Daily schedule because it does not happen every day.

### Use `SESSION_PLAN` instead

Use `SESSION_PLAN` for clinical visits or procedures with a total number of sessions.

Example:

```text
Every 4 weeks
Total sessions: 6
```

### Use `AS_NEEDED` instead

Use `AS_NEEDED` when the patient uses the treatment only when a condition occurs, rather than every day.

## The main distinction

| Routine type | Scheduling idea |
|---|---|
| `DAILY` | Use every day at one or more general time-of-day entries |
| `INTERVAL` | Wait a fixed amount of time between uses |
| `SPECIFIC_DAYS` | Use only on selected weekdays |
| `SESSION_PLAN` | Attend a repeating number of clinical sessions |
| `AS_NEEDED` | Use when needed, subject to limits |

The label **“Daily schedule”** is clear because it describes the complete daily pattern. The most important rule is that the Number of daily uses controls the exact number of Daily use entries:

```text
Daily schedule
Number of daily uses: 2

Daily use 1
Morning · Before Meal · 2 tablets

Daily use 2
Night · No Preference · 1 tablet
```

Each Daily use has its own time of day, meal timing, and dosage.
