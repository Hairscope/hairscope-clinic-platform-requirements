# Convert a Lead to Patient

> Transform a qualified lead into a full patient record so the clinic can begin formal treatment without re-entering information.

## Prerequisites

- Staff account with lead convert permission
- The lead should be in a state ready for conversion (typically `QUALIFIED`)

## Steps

1. Navigate to the **lead profile** page.
2. Click **Convert to Patient** to initiate the conversion process.
3. The system **auto-populates** patient profile fields from the lead's data (name, email, phone, age, gender).
4. Review the pre-filled patient information and make any necessary adjustments.
5. Click **Confirm** to complete the conversion.

## Notes

- **Duplicate checks**: The platform blocks conversion if the lead's email or phone already exists as a patient in the same clinic. You will receive a `CONVERSION_DUPLICATE_EMAIL` or `CONVERSION_DUPLICATE_PHONE` error.
- Upon successful conversion, the lead's status is automatically set to **CONVERTED**.
- All **LeadActions** (interaction history) remain accessible via the patient's history — they are referenced from the original lead record, not copied.
- The **selfie analysis report** (if present) also remains accessible via the patient's linked lead.
- A `LeadConverted` event is emitted and the conversion is recorded in the AuditLog.
- ClinicAdmins and OrganizationAdmins can revert a lead's status from `CONVERTED` if a mistake was made.
