# Assign Leads to Clinics (Manual Mode)

> Review and assign incoming leads to the appropriate clinic when the organization uses MANUAL_ASSIGN mode.

## Prerequisites

- **OrganizationAdmin** role
- Organization `leadAssignmentMode` set to `MANUAL_ASSIGN`

## Steps

1. Navigate to **Leads → Unassigned** to view all leads pending clinic assignment.
2. Review the lead details (name, source, contact info, selfie analysis report if available).
3. Check the **suggested clinic** — this is pre-filled based on the lead source (e.g., visitor-selected clinic from selfie analysis, or `clinicId` from webhook payload).
4. Confirm the suggested clinic or change it to a different clinic within your organization.
5. Click **Save** (or **Assign**) to confirm the clinic assignment.

Once a clinic is assigned, the **LeadDistributionAlgorithm** automatically assigns an active staff member within that clinic to the lead.

## Notes

- In `MANUAL_ASSIGN` mode, all leads from webhooks, selfie analysis, and OrganizationAdmin manual entries start as Unassigned until confirmed.
- Leads created manually by clinic-level staff are NOT affected by `MANUAL_ASSIGN` mode — they are always assigned to the staff member's current clinic.
- Clinic-level staff cannot see or manage Unassigned Leads.
- Changes to `leadAssignmentMode` apply only to future leads; existing leads are not retroactively reassigned.
