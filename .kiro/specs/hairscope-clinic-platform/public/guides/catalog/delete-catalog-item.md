# Delete a Catalog Item

> Remove a catalog item from your clinic's offerings. The system will warn you about any downstream impact before confirming deletion.

## Prerequisites

- You have `catalog.delete` permission assigned to your staff role.

## Steps

1. Navigate to **Catalog** from the main menu.
2. Select the item you want to delete.
3. Click **Delete**.
4. Review the impact warning:
   - **If the item is a SERVICE:** The system displays the count of future appointments that will be cancelled. You must explicitly confirm to proceed. All future appointments (SCHEDULED or CONFIRMED) referencing this service will be cancelled, and cancellation notifications will be sent.
   - **If the item is a non-SERVICE type (MEDICATION, COSMETIC, SUPPLEMENT):** The item is removed from the catalog. Existing session recommendations, Treatment Plans, and Prescriptions retain a snapshot of the item's data (name, description, routine). External links will no longer resolve.
   - **If the item is part of a Treatment Kit:** The item is automatically removed from the kit.
5. Confirm the deletion.

## Important Notes

- **Service deletion is high-impact.** All future appointments for that service will be cancelled and patients will be notified. Past appointments (COMPLETED, CANCELLED, NO_SHOW) retain the service name as a snapshot.
- **Non-service deletion preserves history.** Existing documents and recommendations keep the item's data intact — only the catalog listing is removed.
- **Kit membership is cleaned up automatically.** If the deleted item belongs to one or more kits, it is removed from those kits without requiring manual intervention.
- Deletion is recorded in the audit log.
- Deleted items cannot be recovered — consider editing the item instead if you only need to update its details.
