# Set Up Routines

> Define usage schedules and instructions for catalog items so patients receive clear guidance in their treatment plans and prescriptions.

## Prerequisites

- You have `catalog.create` or `catalog.edit` permission assigned to your staff role.
- A catalog item exists (or you are creating one) that needs a routine.

## Steps

1. Navigate to **Catalog** from the main menu.
2. Select an existing item or create a new one.
3. Locate the **Routine** section on the item form.
4. Fill in the routine fields:
   - **Frequency** — how often the item should be used (e.g., "twice daily", "once a month", "every other day").
   - **Duration** — how long the patient should continue (e.g., "6 months", "3 months", "until next appointment").
   - **Instructions** — free-text guidance (e.g., "apply morning and night", "take with food", "massage into scalp for 2 minutes").
5. Click **Save**.

## How Routines Work

- **Required for MEDICATION items.** A medication cannot be saved without a complete routine.
- **Optional for SERVICE, COSMETIC, and SUPPLEMENT items.** Recommended so patients receive clear instructions.
- **Template behavior:** When a catalog item is recommended in a session, the default routine defined here is **copied** to the recommendation. The doctor can then customize it for that specific patient without affecting the catalog default.
- **Appears in documents:** The routine (default or customized) is included in the Treatment Plan and Prescription PDFs.

## Notes

- Keep frequency descriptions clear and unambiguous — patients will read these directly.
- Instructions support free text, so you can include detailed application methods, timing relative to meals, or any other relevant guidance.
- If you update a routine on a catalog item, existing session recommendations are **not** affected — they retain the routine that was copied at the time of recommendation.
