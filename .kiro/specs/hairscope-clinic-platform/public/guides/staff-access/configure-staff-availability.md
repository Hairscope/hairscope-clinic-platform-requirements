# Configure Staff Availability

> Set up a staff member's working schedule for the smart scheduling engine.

## Prerequisites
- ClinicAdmin role, or the staff member themselves

## Steps

1. Navigate to Staff Management → select staff member → Availability.
   (Or: staff member navigates to their own Profile → Availability.)
2. For each day of the week:
   - Set **Start Time** and **End Time**.
   - Set **Available** (yes/no).
3. Save the schedule.

## How It Affects Appointments

- Staff availability is used by the SmartScheduling engine to assign staff to appointments.
- A slot is only shown as available if the clinic is open AND at least one qualified staff member is available.
- Staff with no availability configured are excluded from SmartScheduling entirely.
- Availability is never exposed to patients — only the resulting available slots are shown.

## Important Notes
- Staff availability is independent of clinic working hours.
- After an inter-clinic transfer, availability resets to empty.
- Changes apply to future appointment assignments only.
- All changes are recorded in the audit log.
