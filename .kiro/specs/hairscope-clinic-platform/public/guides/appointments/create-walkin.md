# Create a Walk-In Appointment

> Quickly register a patient who arrives without a prior booking directly from the calendar view.

## Prerequisites

- Staff account with appointment create permission
- The patient must already exist in the system

## Steps

1. Navigate to the **Calendar** page (main appointments view).
2. Click **Add Appointment** from the toolbar, or click directly on a **time slot** in the calendar.
3. Select the **Patient** from the patient list.
4. Select the **Service** to be performed.
5. Confirm the appointment — the status is set directly to **CONFIRMED** (skipping the `SCHEDULED` step).

## Notes

- Walk-in appointments bypass the `SCHEDULED` status and are created directly as **CONFIRMED**.
- A **DRAFT session** is automatically created for the patient when the appointment reaches `CONFIRMED` status (if one does not already exist for the same session type in that clinic).
- The SmartScheduling engine still assigns a qualified staff member.
- No booking confirmation email is sent for walk-ins since the patient is already present.
- Walk-in appointments appear immediately on the calendar view.
