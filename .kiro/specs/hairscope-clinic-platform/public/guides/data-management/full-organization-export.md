# Full Organization Export

> Export all data across all clinics in your organization for backup, migration, or compliance purposes.

## Prerequisites

- **OrganizationAdmin** role
- Access to Organization Settings

## Steps

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings → Data Export**.
2. Click **Export All** to initiate a full organization export.
3. Select the **format**:
   - **CSV** — comma-separated values
   - **Excel** — .xlsx spreadsheet
4. Click **Submit** to queue the export.
5. The export runs in the **background** — you will receive a notification when it's ready.
6. Download the exported file from the notification or export history.

## Notes

- ⚠️ **Deferred feature** — this functionality will be available in a later version.
- This export includes **all data across all clinics** in the organization (patients, leads, appointments, sessions, invoices, etc.).
- The export is processed asynchronously due to the potentially large volume of data.
- Only OrganizationAdmins can perform a full organization export.
- A notification is sent when the export is complete and ready for download.
