# Save a Session for AI Analysis

> Lock the session images and submit them for AI-powered analysis. Once saved, the session moves to SAVED status and images cannot be modified.

## Prerequisites

- The session is in **DRAFT** status.
- All mandatory images have been captured:
  - At least **6 trichoscopy images** (one from each mandatory position: P1–P6).
  - At least **1 FRONTAL global image**.

## Steps

1. Open the DRAFT session and verify all mandatory images are captured.
2. Click **Save Session**.
3. The system validates that all requirements are met:
   - 6 trichoscopy images from mandatory positions (P1 Frontal, P2 Left Temporal, P3 Right Temporal, P4 Top of Head, P5 Crown, P6 Occipital).
   - 1 FRONTAL global image.
4. If validation passes:
   - Images are **locked** — no new images can be added after this point.
   - Session status changes to **SAVED**.
   - AI analysis is triggered automatically.
5. Wait for a notification when AI analysis is complete.

## Notes

- If validation fails, the system will indicate which mandatory images are missing. Return to the capture step to add them.
- After saving, you **cannot add, replace, or remove images**. Make sure all desired images are captured before saving.
- AI analysis runs asynchronously — you do not need to wait at the screen. You will receive:
  - An **in-app toaster notification** (web).
  - A **push notification** (mobile).
- If AI analysis fails after retries, you will be notified and can resubmit failed images manually.
