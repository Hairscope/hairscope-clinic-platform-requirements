# Edit Recommendations After Signing

> Modify recommendations on a session that already has signed documents (Treatment Plan or Prescription), maintaining a full audit trail within the document.

## Prerequisites

- The session is in **COMPLETED** status.
- A Treatment Plan or Prescription has already been generated and signed.
- You have `patients.edit` permission assigned to your staff role.
- You have a **digital signature** uploaded to your staff profile.

## Steps

1. Open the **COMPLETED session** with existing signed documents.
2. Navigate to the **Recommendations** section.
3. Edit the recommendations as needed (add new items, remove existing items, or modify routines).
4. For each removed or changed item, **provide a reason** for the change (required).
5. The system records the change with:
   - The original item shown with **strike-through** formatting.
   - The **reason** for the change.
   - The **date** of the change.
   - Your **digital signature** alongside the struck-through item.
6. New or replacement items are added as new line items below.
7. **Re-approve and re-sign** to generate a new PDF version of the Treatment Plan and/or Prescription.

## Important Notes

- **A reason is required** for every change to a previously signed recommendation. The system will not allow changes without a reason.
- **Previous versions are retained.** The old PDF version is kept for audit purposes but marked as superseded. Only the latest version is the active document.
- The strike-through edit history creates an **immutable audit trail** within the document itself — nothing is deleted or hidden.
- This applies to **all recommendation types**: medications, cosmetics, supplements, and services.
- The new PDF incorporates the full history: original items (struck through with reason/date/signature) plus new items.
- All changes are recorded in the audit log.
