# Fill Session Questionnaire

> Complete the structured questionnaire during a hair analysis session to help the platform determine root cause of hair loss and calculate the patient's stress level.

## Prerequisites

- You have an open session (any status — questionnaire can be filled or edited at any point).
- The session type is HAIR_ANALYSIS.

## Steps

1. Open the session for the patient.
2. Go to the **Questionnaire** section.
3. Answer questions across **5 categories** (5 questions each):
   - **Daily Habits** — lifestyle and daily routine questions.
   - **Medical Conditions** — relevant health history.
   - **Physical/Emotional Shock** — recent trauma or significant life events.
   - **Hairstyling & Treatments** — chemical treatments, heat styling, etc.
   - **Genetics** — family history of hair loss.
4. Complete the **Stress Test** (~10 questions) — a separate questionnaire measuring stress levels.
5. Once all answers are submitted:
   - The system auto-calculates the **RootCause** (determined cause of hair loss based on a defined formula).
   - The system calculates and displays the **StressOMeter** score.

## Notes

- Each category always has exactly **5 active questions**. ClinicAdmins can customize which questions are active per category.
- The **StressOMeter threshold** may trigger automatic product suggestions for stress-related hair loss items from your catalog.
- Questionnaire answers **can be edited after session completion**. Editing triggers:
  - Recalculation of RootCause and StressOMeter.
  - The existing Clinical Trichoscopy Report is marked as **outdated** (an indicator is shown on the report page).
  - The report is NOT auto-regenerated — staff must explicitly trigger regeneration.
- Identical questionnaire answers always produce identical RootCause and StressOMeter results.
