# Set Up Appointment Reminders

> Configure when and how appointment reminders are sent to patients and staff before scheduled visits.

## Prerequisites

- **OrganizationAdmin** or **ClinicAdmin** role
- Access to Communication settings

## Steps

1. Navigate to **Communication → Reminder Rules** (or Organization Settings → Communication → Reminders).
2. Configure one or more reminder rules with the following settings:
   - **Offset** — time before the appointment (e.g., 24 hours before, 2 hours before)
   - **Channels** — which channels to use (email, WhatsApp, SMS)
   - **Recipient** — who receives the reminder: Patient, Staff, or Both
   - **Template** — which notification template to use
3. Add additional rules as needed (e.g., a 24h email reminder + a 2h WhatsApp reminder).
4. Click **Save** to apply the rules.

## Notes

- **Default rules** (provided until customized):
  - 24 hours before: Email to Patient
  - 2 hours before: Email + WhatsApp to Patient
- **OrganizationAdmins** set Organization-level rules that apply to all clinics.
- **ClinicAdmins** can override Organization-level rules for their specific clinic. Clinic-level overrides take precedence.
- Rule changes apply to **future appointments only** — existing reminder schedules are not retroactively modified.
- All rule changes are recorded in the AuditLog.
