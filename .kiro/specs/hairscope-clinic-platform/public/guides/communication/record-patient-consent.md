# Record Patient Consent

> Document a patient's consent (or revocation) for receiving communications via specific channels and for specific purposes.

## Prerequisites

- **ClinicAdmin** role
- Access to the patient's profile

## Steps

1. Navigate to the **patient profile → Consent** section.
2. Select the **purpose** for which consent is being recorded:
   - Appointment Reminders
   - Treatment Follow-Up
   - Marketing
   - Operational
3. Select the **channel** (email, WhatsApp, SMS, push).
4. Record whether consent is **granted** or **revoked**.
5. Click **Save** to store the consent record.

## Notes

- Consent records include: recipient, purpose, channel, granted/revoked status, timestamp, and the staff member who recorded it.
- **Transactional notifications** (security alerts, password reset) are NOT affected by consent — they are always delivered regardless of consent state.
- Patients can **revoke consent** at any time via an unsubscribe mechanism.
- Consent records are **immutable** — revocation creates a new record rather than modifying the original grant.
- The platform requires explicit consent before sending non-transactional notifications to patients and leads.
- All consent changes are recorded in the AuditLog.
