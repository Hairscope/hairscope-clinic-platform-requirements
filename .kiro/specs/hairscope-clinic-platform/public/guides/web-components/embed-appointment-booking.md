# Embed Appointment Booking on Your Website

> Add the Appointment Booking web component to your website so patients and leads can self-book appointments online.

## Prerequisites

- Organization API key generated (same key used for Selfie Analysis component)
- Your website domain added to the Allowed Domains list

## Steps

1. Get your **Organization API key** from Organization Settings → Web Components (same key as Selfie Analysis).
2. Ensure your website's domain is in the **Allowed Domains** list.
3. Include the **script tag** in your website's HTML:
   ```html
   <script src="https://[platform-url]/components/booking.js" data-key="YOUR_API_KEY"></script>
   ```
4. Add the **booking component element** where you want it to appear:
   ```html
   <hairscope-booking></hairscope-booking>
   ```

## Notes

- The component displays:
  - Available **services** configured for the clinic
  - **Calendar** with available dates
  - **Time slots** for the selected date and service
- Patients can:
  - **Book** new appointments
  - **Search** for existing appointments (verified via OTP)
  - **Reschedule** their appointments
  - **Cancel** their appointments
- The component shows the same slot availability as the staff booking interface.
- Patients can confirm attendance via a link in their booking confirmation email or through the component.
- The component uses the same Organization API key as the Selfie Analysis component.
- The component will show "Access Denied" on domains not in the Allowed Domains list.
