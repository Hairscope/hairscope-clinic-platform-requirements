# Add a New Clinic

> Create a new clinic within your organization to expand operations to a new location.

## Prerequisites

- **OrganizationAdmin** role
- Access to Organization management

## Steps

1. Navigate to **Organization → Clinics**.
2. Click **Add Clinic** to open the new clinic form.
3. Enter the minimum required fields:
   - **Name** — the clinic's display name
   - **Address** — the clinic's physical address
4. Click **Save** to create the clinic.
5. Configure the full clinic profile later:
   - **Timezone** (IANA format) — required before appointments can be booked
   - **Currency** (ISO 4217) — required before catalog items can be created
   - **Working Hours** — per-day operating schedule
   - **Logo**, **website**, **email**, **phone**, **language**, **terms and conditions**
6. Assign a **ClinicAdmin** to the new clinic — the clinic is not fully operational until at least one ClinicAdmin is assigned.

## Notes

- A clinic requires at least one active ClinicAdmin at all times before it can be fully operational.
- The timezone must be configured before appointment slot calculations can work.
- The currency must be configured before the Catalog module can be used.
- Working hours define when the clinic is open and drive patient-facing appointment slot availability.
- The clinic creation is recorded in the AuditLog.
